				<description><![CDATA[Ashley gives an update about attending EDHEC in Nice and what their Global MBA program is like.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I think it time for me to write a blog post. Mostly since I‚Äôm procrastinating my criminal risk paper. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f607.png" alt="üòá" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>I feel the need to walk you through a typical week for me since in general my program is so different from an undergraduate program or even a typical master‚Äôs program.&nbsp; And, despite what my Instagram looks like, I am not on vacation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A little background on my program.&nbsp; I am in Nice, France in an English-speaking Global MBA at EDHEC that is scheduled for 10 months with potential to be extended IF my final project is an internship and IF that internship is longer than 2 months.&nbsp; EDHEC‚Äôs global MBA really focuses on accepting a diverse student population. My current class has about 85 students from roughly 30 different nationalities. I am also part of the consulting club and the women in leadership club.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e20182814333123b82c4db1d45186768-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-74" srcset="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e20182814333123b82c4db1d45186768-1.jpg 800w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e20182814333123b82c4db1d45186768-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e20182814333123b82c4db1d45186768-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption>What a lovely building&#8230; that I view from the inside all day</figcaption></figure>



<p>My schedule is supposed to be class from 9 am &#8211; 4:30 pm with an hour and 15 min lunch break.&nbsp; In reality, while class always starts at 9, my day rarely ends at 4:30.&nbsp; Once a week I have French class from 5-7pm with homework and exams. 1-3 times a week I have sessions happening during lunch. 2-5 times a week I have ‚Äúextracurricular‚Äù academic meetings or speakers after class. About once a month those extracurriculars bleed into the weekend.&nbsp; Every other week they creep into meetings before class even starts. None of that includes group meetings for team assignments as those are scheduled on an as needed basis. The time after the extracurriculars I spend studying or working on assignments.&nbsp; If I am really optimistic with my progress or too stressed, I might pop down to the gym for 30 minutes to an hour. Except when I have morning meetings, I usually get to school around 8:45-9am and get home around 8-10:15pm. School closes at 10pm and it takes me about 15min to get home. I have yet to arrive home done with all the work I needed to do in a day.&nbsp; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f613.png" alt="üòì" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>On a normal week, I will have multiple classes that rotate through morning and afternoon sessions. Classes are usually 40 hours of lecture time over one to two weeks. This week for example I will have Philosophy (which is continued from earlier) and I will be starting Marketing and Managing the Internationalization of the Firm both of which will be continued next week. Instead of normal semesters the school revolves more around intakes, one group started in January and the other in September.&nbsp; Some classes are mixed with the January intake in which case we are divided into 2 groups where one group has morning sessions of a particular class and the other group has the afternoon session and visa versa.&nbsp; Other times it will just be my group, the Septembers.&nbsp; We just had our first week break, will have a slightly longer break over Christmas and new years, and one last week vacation in February.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0315-e1572810656171-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-75" srcset="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0315-e1572810656171-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0315-e1572810656171-225x300.jpg 225w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0315-e1572810656171-300x400.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>Aside from those breaks, my normal view looks like this. Thank God for wine!</figcaption></figure>



<p>My success is in part made possible by my ability to function on less sleep, coffee, Dale being a good house husband, and Koki‚Äôs seemingly indifference to my clear and abrupt abandonment. There is a clear consensus among my classmates that I am extremely lucky to be here with such a supportive spouse and am healthier and less sleep deprived to prove it.&nbsp; Although my pizza consumption has increased exponentially.&nbsp; Which if anyone who knew me before undergrad might know that pizza was one of the biggest contributors to my freshman 20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ok I really need to do my paper now‚Ä¶.right after a snack. &nbsp;Which is not pizza. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f615.png" alt="üòï" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<description><![CDATA[Bringing our pup to France was a bit complicated between finding the right flight, getting her the proper crate, and ensuring all the paperwork was in order!]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I love my dog Koki way too much. It actually is strange to me how attached to her I am. I grew up with dogs and of course loved having them, but Koki is MY dog. Ashley and I raised her from a puppy. We spent time training her, socializing her with other dogs and people, and even took her to school. Like I really love this dog. But my love PALES in comparison to Ashley&#8217;s. If Ash had to choose between me and the dog, she would not hesitate on picking the pup. When it came to researching ways to get Koki to France, Ashley had to leave that to me. You see, if you start researching how to move a dog abroad, lots of sites&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/travel-safely-your-pet-car-airplane-ship-or-train" target="_blank">such as the Humane Society</a>&nbsp;recommend that you do not fly dogs&#8211;particularly in cargo&#8211;because, sometimes, they do not make it and it was stressing Ashley out.</p>



<p>Well, Koki is 50 lbs and cannot fly in the cabin anywhere. Unless we decided to send her by boat (which you can do luxury style for 4k) or charter a flight (as low as 10k by one service!), she was going to have to go in cargo. Many airlines‚Äîbig ones such as Delta and most smaller airlines&#8211;do not even allow dogs to fly anymore. If they will fly your dog, you&#8217;ll want her to be in a temperature and pressure controlled area. It is also highly recommended that you fly your pet direct to avoid gettin lost in transit or left out on the tarmac in the elements. In most European airports to transfer flights, I found that you would also have to claim your dog and then recheck them. I could just imagine Koki hating me forever if I took her off a flight only to try to shove her back into the crate for another!&nbsp;Blarg, lots of restrictions!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that made it tricky to get a flight. There were only two airlines flying direct from the US (like anywhere in the country) to Nice and neither allowed pets. With Koki vetoing any transfer, I looked for airports nearby but ended up with Paris.  Paris opened more affordable flights and the next best was flying into Italy (which would mean her and I having to cross borders). After researching airlines that do take pets, I went with&nbsp;AirFrance. They had a pretty comprehensive pet policy, assured me that the space was temperature and pressure controlled, and only charged an extra $200 for her. You generally have to call the airlines to ensure that they have space in the cargo for your pet which meant I had to book a flight and wait a couple days for them to confirm space (they said if there wasn&#8217;t they would get me another flight or refund). Whew, flight booked!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately the flight was only step one; to get started on this journey though there was more to be done. Step two: get her a crate meeting all the requirements of the journey (check with your airline, but there is actually an¬†<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/live-animals/pets/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank">organization that sets standards for this kinda, IATA</a>). I got one off Amazon that was¬†<em>almost</em>¬†perfect, but I was required to buy metal bolts since it came with plastic.¬†Koki had her dinner and sleep in the crate in upcoming weeks so she would be comfortable and feel like it&#8217;s her home. I also got her what looked like a big hamster feeder for water and taught her to use that so she&#8217;d be sure to have water on the flight. All that was probably around $200, but ok, good, baby girl had what she needed.¬†</p>



<p>Step three: I needed to get her paperwork in order. Super annoying. Overall, they do not require much from US to France, but the timeline is quick. All they required was a USDA approved vet to examine her, sign off that she&#8217;s in good health, make sure her rabies shots are in order, and check her microchip. Our normal vet did all that (though it was $100 bucks). The trickier part was that paperwork had to be sent to one of two USDA offices to be verified and signed off on for like $30. And from the vet appointment to USDA to landing in France, everything had take no more than 10 days. I probably spent another $50 on FedEx sending paperwork around.¬†</p>



<p>With all that accomplished we were ready to fly! We had been to the airport a number of times (mostly to drop off and pick up mum) and Koki was always fine. But of course this time she panicked. I took her to the pet relief area and she must have smelled other dogs&#8217; fear because from that point on she was not happy. Luckily my father-in-law, Frank, was there to help me look after her, put the crate together, handle the baggage, and check in. Koki and I went into the back workings where I met a very nice TSA lady who checked over her crate and tested it (and her food!) for explosives. Which I guess is good.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6589.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-65" srcset="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6589.jpg 756w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6589-224x300.jpg 224w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6589-300x402.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px" /><figcaption>Think the crate is big enough?</figcaption></figure>



<p>AirFrance&nbsp;was super cool. After I got onto my flight, a hostess came and told me Koki was aboard. They legit asked me what temperature I wanted her area set to. Though they used Celsius so I had no idea what to say. &#8220;Just, uh, set it to the same as for the rest of us.&#8221;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, I picked her up in oversized luggage easy enough and then immediately walked into the customs area. I had all my paperwork but absolutely no idea what to do with it. I stopped in front of a group of customs agents, but everyone else kept walking around me and the agents ignored the giant dog crate and myself. I walked up to the doors to exit and did the same thing with more agents who glanced at me and then looked away. Cool. I walked out. Maybe you don&#8217;t need all that paper work after all? Perhaps don&#8217;t press your luck.</p>



<p>We quickly made it out of the airport, but failed to find any pet relief area (seriously de Gaulle, get yourself together). Koki did not actually seem to mind and was just super happy to be freed from her crate. After that long red-eye, we were finally free in France and off dragging way too much baggage into the car rentals to find a way south!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily Koki has not seemed at all traumatized from the ordeal. Though I will say that she still seems to look at her crate with distrust&#8230;&nbsp;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[In the beginning, there was Dale. He was an adventurous sort and every time he went on one, he felt he had to share it. Probably because he was vain and thought himself overly funny. Well, this time he's off to Nice, France. Back in Europe since that seemed to work out so well the first time round.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s been a hell of a year. Ash had just started at NIH, we moved to Rockville, we did a ton of traveling including to three of our friends&#8217; weddings and a couple trips abroad, Ashley got accepted into grad school, I got promoted, we got MARRIED with our own amazing wedding, and now, to top it all off, we&#8217;ve moved to Nice, France for her MBA! It&#8217;s been a crazy, BUSY ride.</p>



<p>Working at Deloitte was a great experience. I had an amazing team of smart, dedicated, and truly wonderful people. I learned a whole lot about consulting and working with clients using everything I know or could think of with data to solve problems. I probably learned more than I&#8217;d care to admit, mostly through osmosis, about process improvements, communication, change management, and&#8211;dare I say it&#8211;project management (I mostly learned to stay away from that!). That&#8217;s what happens when you are around smart people all day. And I guess now I know more than ever about workforce strategy and management. I did try to stick to the data analytics side of things before people started to get ideas that I know anything more (which would invariably involve creating a PowerPoint or white paper or something).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-45" srcset="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055-150x150.jpg 150w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055-300x300.jpg 300w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055-768x768.jpg 768w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Also Deloitte folk also know how to party</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the down time, Ashley and I took some fun trips. For her dirty thirty we spirited away (I think we may have even flown Spirit) to Jamaica and had a romantic getaway. Ash hurt her foot so we did a bit less of the hiking than we wanted, but we still made a 30 foot plunge into a lake. Koki enjoyed camping with us, some Peace Corps buds, Danny and Jamexis with a surprise visit from Jacob, and a few of their friends. We attended a few lovely weddings: Diego and Lia&#8217;s in Delaware, Kara and Vic&#8217;s in Maine, and Drew and Lindsay&#8217;s in California. Obviously that meant just as many bachelor and bachelorette parties! My personal favorite being Mexico with Diego and company. He has a hell of a crew and partying in Mexico&#8230; well, we need to go back cause there was simply not enough time (or tacos). Odd considering I slept a cumulative 5 hours over the weekend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-1016x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-47" srcset="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-1016x1024.jpg 1016w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-150x150.jpg 150w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-298x300.jpg 298w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-768x774.jpg 768w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-300x302.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px" /><figcaption>Between mezcal and being serenaded, you could say I fell in love with Mexico City.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amidst all of that, Ashley and I planned our own wedding! Or I should say, Ashley planned our own wedding and I helped sometimes doing things she told me to do! While I was no good and didn&#8217;t enjoy the planning and preparing part&#8211;with the exception of a couple great trips staying with Tony and Robin in Wilmington and ironing out details&#8211;the wedding itself was freaking amazing! Hell, the whole weekend was a blast and the day of was out of this world awesome. We were visited by the best of friends, danced our hearts out, and Ashley and I got to share our love with everyone. I obviously teared up, but even Ashley had to fight back a few! I cannot give enough thanks to everyone who was part of it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DASH_385_PRINT-1024x682.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-46" srcset="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DASH_385_PRINT-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DASH_385_PRINT-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DASH_385_PRINT-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DASH_385_PRINT.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Look at us! We&#8217;re so damn cute!</figcaption></figure>



<p>With all that loveliness and fantastic people and everything seeming to be just right&#8230; We&#8217;ve grabbed the dog, uprooted everything, and moved abroad. Ashley got herself into a respectable International MBA program that just so happens to be situated in Nice, a cute little beach town in southern France. I, being the devoted husband that I am, just have to go with her. I mean there really is no other option, right?</p>



<p>Since I&#8217;m off on another adventure, you lucky folk get to look forward to another blog. This time around I will even have solid internet access, so no excuses. There will be pictures and stories of shenanigans; everything to your hearts&#8217; desires. Keep in touch! Despite my occasional jaunts abroad, I love you all and miss you when I&#8217;m gone.</p>



<p>But I mean, it&#8217;s been five years since Africa anyway. So this was practically overdue.</p>
