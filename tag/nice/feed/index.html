				<description><![CDATA[Ashley gives an update about attending EDHEC in Nice and what their Global MBA program is like.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I think it time for me to write a blog post. Mostly since I‚Äôm procrastinating my criminal risk paper. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f607.png" alt="üòá" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>I feel the need to walk you through a typical week for me since in general my program is so different from an undergraduate program or even a typical master‚Äôs program.&nbsp; And, despite what my Instagram looks like, I am not on vacation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A little background on my program.&nbsp; I am in Nice, France in an English-speaking Global MBA at EDHEC that is scheduled for 10 months with potential to be extended IF my final project is an internship and IF that internship is longer than 2 months.&nbsp; EDHEC‚Äôs global MBA really focuses on accepting a diverse student population. My current class has about 85 students from roughly 30 different nationalities. I am also part of the consulting club and the women in leadership club.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e20182814333123b82c4db1d45186768-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-74" srcset="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e20182814333123b82c4db1d45186768-1.jpg 800w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e20182814333123b82c4db1d45186768-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e20182814333123b82c4db1d45186768-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption>What a lovely building&#8230; that I view from the inside all day</figcaption></figure>



<p>My schedule is supposed to be class from 9 am &#8211; 4:30 pm with an hour and 15 min lunch break.&nbsp; In reality, while class always starts at 9, my day rarely ends at 4:30.&nbsp; Once a week I have French class from 5-7pm with homework and exams. 1-3 times a week I have sessions happening during lunch. 2-5 times a week I have ‚Äúextracurricular‚Äù academic meetings or speakers after class. About once a month those extracurriculars bleed into the weekend.&nbsp; Every other week they creep into meetings before class even starts. None of that includes group meetings for team assignments as those are scheduled on an as needed basis. The time after the extracurriculars I spend studying or working on assignments.&nbsp; If I am really optimistic with my progress or too stressed, I might pop down to the gym for 30 minutes to an hour. Except when I have morning meetings, I usually get to school around 8:45-9am and get home around 8-10:15pm. School closes at 10pm and it takes me about 15min to get home. I have yet to arrive home done with all the work I needed to do in a day.&nbsp; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f613.png" alt="üòì" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>On a normal week, I will have multiple classes that rotate through morning and afternoon sessions. Classes are usually 40 hours of lecture time over one to two weeks. This week for example I will have Philosophy (which is continued from earlier) and I will be starting Marketing and Managing the Internationalization of the Firm both of which will be continued next week. Instead of normal semesters the school revolves more around intakes, one group started in January and the other in September.&nbsp; Some classes are mixed with the January intake in which case we are divided into 2 groups where one group has morning sessions of a particular class and the other group has the afternoon session and visa versa.&nbsp; Other times it will just be my group, the Septembers.&nbsp; We just had our first week break, will have a slightly longer break over Christmas and new years, and one last week vacation in February.</p>

Thank God for wine!</figcaption></figure>



<p>My success is in part made possible by my ability to function on less sleep, coffee, Dale being a good house husband, and Koki‚Äôs seemingly indifference to my clear and abrupt abandonment. There is a clear consensus among my classmates that I am extremely lucky to be here with such a supportive spouse and am healthier and less sleep deprived to prove it.&nbsp; Although my pizza consumption has increased exponentially.&nbsp; Which if anyone who knew me before undergrad might know that pizza was one of the biggest contributors to my freshman 20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ok I really need to do my paper now‚Ä¶.right after a snack. &nbsp;Which is not pizza. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f615.png" alt="üòï" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<description><![CDATA[In the beginning, there was Dale. He was an adventurous sort and every time he went on one, he felt he had to share it. Probably because he was vain and thought himself overly funny. Well, this time he's off to Nice, France. Back in Europe since that seemed to work out so well the first time round.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s been a hell of a year. Ash had just started at NIH, we moved to Rockville, we did a ton of traveling including to three of our friends&#8217; weddings and a couple trips abroad, Ashley got accepted into grad school, I got promoted, we got MARRIED with our own amazing wedding, and now, to top it all off, we&#8217;ve moved to Nice, France for her MBA! It&#8217;s been a crazy, BUSY ride.</p>



<p>Working at Deloitte was a great experience. I had an amazing team of smart, dedicated, and truly wonderful people. I learned a whole lot about consulting and working with clients using everything I know or could think of with data to solve problems. I probably learned more than I&#8217;d care to admit, mostly through osmosis, about process improvements, communication, change management, and&#8211;dare I say it&#8211;project management (I mostly learned to stay away from that!). That&#8217;s what happens when you are around smart people all day. And I guess now I know more than ever about workforce strategy and management. I did try to stick to the data analytics side of things before people started to get ideas that I know anything more (which would invariably involve creating a PowerPoint or white paper or something).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-45" srcset="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055-150x150.jpg 150w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055-300x300.jpg 300w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055-768x768.jpg 768w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190915_171919_055.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Also Deloitte folk also know how to party</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the down time, Ashley and I took some fun trips. For her dirty thirty we spirited away (I think we may have even flown Spirit) to Jamaica and had a romantic getaway. Ash hurt her foot so we did a bit less of the hiking than we wanted, but we still made a 30 foot plunge into a lake. Koki enjoyed camping with us, some Peace Corps buds, Danny and Jamexis with a surprise visit from Jacob, and a few of their friends. We attended a few lovely weddings: Diego and Lia&#8217;s in Delaware, Kara and Vic&#8217;s in Maine, and Drew and Lindsay&#8217;s in California. Obviously that meant just as many bachelor and bachelorette parties! My personal favorite being Mexico with Diego and company. He has a hell of a crew and partying in Mexico&#8230; well, we need to go back cause there was simply not enough time (or tacos). Odd considering I slept a cumulative 5 hours over the weekend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-1016x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-47" srcset="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-1016x1024.jpg 1016w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-150x150.jpg 150w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-298x300.jpg 298w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-768x774.jpg 768w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_1339-e1570462143260-300x302.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px" /><figcaption>Between mezcal and being serenaded, you could say I fell in love with Mexico City.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amidst all of that, Ashley and I planned our own wedding! Or I should say, Ashley planned our own wedding and I helped sometimes doing things she told me to do! While I was no good and didn&#8217;t enjoy the planning and preparing part&#8211;with the exception of a couple great trips staying with Tony and Robin in Wilmington and ironing out details&#8211;the wedding itself was freaking amazing! Hell, the whole weekend was a blast and the day of was out of this world awesome. We were visited by the best of friends, danced our hearts out, and Ashley and I got to share our love with everyone. I obviously teared up, but even Ashley had to fight back a few! I cannot give enough thanks to everyone who was part of it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DASH_385_PRINT-1024x682.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-46" srcset="https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DASH_385_PRINT-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DASH_385_PRINT-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DASH_385_PRINT-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://viveledash.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DASH_385_PRINT.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Look at us! We&#8217;re so damn cute!</figcaption></figure>



<p>With all that loveliness and fantastic people and everything seeming to be just right&#8230; We&#8217;ve grabbed the dog, uprooted everything, and moved abroad. Ashley got herself into a respectable International MBA program that just so happens to be situated in Nice, a cute little beach town in southern France. I, being the devoted husband that I am, just have to go with her. I mean there really is no other option, right?</p>



<p>Since I&#8217;m off on another adventure, you lucky folk get to look forward to another blog. This time around I will even have solid internet access, so no excuses. There will be pictures and stories of shenanigans; everything to your hearts&#8217; desires. Keep in touch! Despite my occasional jaunts abroad, I love you all and miss you when I&#8217;m gone.</p>



<p>But I mean, it&#8217;s been five years since Africa anyway. So this was practically overdue.</p>
